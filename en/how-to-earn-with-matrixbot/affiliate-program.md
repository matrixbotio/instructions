## Earning MTXB tokens

To earn MTXB tokens by attracting new users, you need to[ go to our Telegram bot ](https://t.me/get\_matrixbot?start=help\_org\_ru)and send it the `/share` command.

From each new user you will receive tokens, which you can then withdraw to your wallet.

## How to earn % of commissions

When you bring a new user to MatrixBot, you earn % based on everything:

1. **Commissions on income of trading bots**.
2. Commissions for **buying and selling bots on the Market**.
3. Signing up for a **premium subscription**.
4. Purchasing **VIP services.**

Advantages of working with the MatrixBot affiliate program:

1. **There is no hold**, earnings are accrued in real time.
2. **Easy conditions for approval of creatives** (if you create your own advertising materials). All you have to do is [write to the project manager](https://t.me/matrixbotio\_manager) if you have any questions.
3. **No intermediaries**, work directly with the project.

On the website in the "Account" section you can find your affiliate links.

You can promote both a link to register on the site and a link to receive a guide to trading bots.

When you promote a link to receive a guide, the referred user follows the link, your affiliate code is attached to it, and when the user proceeds to register, they receive your affiliate link.
