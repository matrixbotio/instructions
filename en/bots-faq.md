# Bots FAQ

<details>

<summary>Error: Insufficient funds for the minimum order. How to fix this?</summary>

You can adjust the **Factor** value, reduce the number of orders, or increase the deposit.

It is not recommended to set the first order too close to the minimum, as the minimum order size depends on the price. With each new cycle, there is a risk that the balance will be insufficient for the minimum order.

<summary>How to Reduce Risks in Trading?</summary>

**Tip 1:** Allocate 5% of your total deposit for each bot. With $5000, this would be $250 per bot. With $1000, it would be $50 per bot. To maintain flexibility in settings, it's essential to choose trading pairs with a minimum order around $1. [You can find them here.](https://matrixbot.io/tools/volatility)

**Tip 2:** Create groups of bots. These can include bots with different levels of risk and return (conservative and aggressive). Inactive bots can be hidden by "parking" them.

**Tip 3:** You can also categorize bots by coin types:

* Meme tokens (DOGE, DOGS, CATS, NEIRO, BRETT, etc.);
* CEX (KCS, BNB, FTT, etc.);
* DEX (CAKE, UNI, SUSHI, BURGER, etc.);
* AI (FET, GPT, etc.);
* Privacy and anonymity tokens (XMR, CRP, etc.);
* Decentralized storage (STORJ, FIL, EMC, etc.);
* First-generation blockchain (BTC, LTC, DGB, ZEC, etc.);
* Second-generation blockchain (ETH, AVAX, ADA, etc.);\
  and other categories.

[Our MatrixBot AI](https://matrixbot.io/ai-bot) can help you create a bot for all these coins and approaches.
