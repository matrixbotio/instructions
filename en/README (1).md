Bot start. After an error, the bot will restart from its last state when the start button is pressed.

Stop. Two modes:

\- `Soft stop` on first press. The bot will stop gently and wait for take profit orders to be executed before stopping.\
\- `Hard stop` on second press. The bot will stop as is; orders may remain on the exchange or be removed at user's choice.

Additionally, if the bot is in error mode and does not plan to resume trading from where it left off, pressing the stop button clears any errors and allows a new lap to begin after restarting.

Menu. Opens up additional menu options.

<summary>How does bot stopping work?</summary>

If you press the bot stop button once, it will turn red, and the bot will enter a waiting mode to complete the current cycle and then stop.

If the bot is in monitoring mode or waiting for indicators and no order has been executed, the bot will stop immediately.

If you press the button again, you can stop the bot immediately, with or without canceling the orders.
